## Love is beautiful.

When Tomisin and Samson got engaged, they wanted a website where their loved ones could read their love story, view their beautiful picture gallery, and easily send them wedding presents- in cash or in kind.

And that's exactly what I gave them!

The website was amazingly simple, inviting, and user-friendly.

Well-wishers could easily choose to send the couple monetary gifts via bank transfer or Flutterwave.

And those who wanted to purchase gifts could choose from a range of items the couple had requested. What could be better than giving someone exactly what they want?

And oh, the couple loved their website!
